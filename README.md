# Online Elm format

I got tired of writing Elm code in Slack or in Ellie and not being able to format like Elm format does, so I created this simple app available online.

## Installation

Required: Node.js and npm
```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

Go to `localhost:3000` and play with it.
